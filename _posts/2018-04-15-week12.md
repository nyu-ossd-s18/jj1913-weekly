## Project Contributions

My main contribution to the group so far has to be working on this issue that we set out for ourselves, which an issue a user had with favicon's being present for `qute://` links within the browser. However, upon further inspection the issue seems to be more difficult then initially thought. 

Originally I believed the issue would be simple, however the more I work on the issue, and we update the developers more seems to be uncovered making the issue more difficult. I thought a simple adding a `<link rel = ...>` tag to the `base.html` template would be able to work, however this would only work if we referenced an image that was from outside the site. I later learned that I needed to implement a python handler for the favicon image, which I was able to do, however this didn't fix the issue and after some testing and discussing with the developers it seems the issue is greater and has to do with links not being relative within the base code. 

All my code done to contribute the fix is on the team github (my function for python handler) In order to fix relative links I know I need to make changes to the scripts loading. However I did provide an alternative solution which simply links a favicon from the web, but this is a bit of a sloppy solution.
