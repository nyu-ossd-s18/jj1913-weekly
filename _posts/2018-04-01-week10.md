3. Is Google taking any steps in making their own software more open?

## Project Progress

Our group has selected two main issues we wish to work on and submit pull requests for. One is a documentation issue, the other is adding a neat feature that a user requested. 
Doing further research on the documentation question, we noticed there had been many changes made to the documentation since the issue has been created. However there had been no updates on the issue so I made a post inquiring if some of the requests made in the issue had been solved or not. [here](https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/issues/2851#issuecomment-377082479). It seems as if the only real issue left is providing details for running tests.
The second is adding a feature that would allow a user to search a term up in multiple search enginges. The main contributors said it wouldn't be that hard of a feature to add, so I've been attempting to familiarize myself with the functions used in this process before diving into IRC to inquire details.
