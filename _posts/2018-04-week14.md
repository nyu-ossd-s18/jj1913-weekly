# Reflection

Overall I really enjoyed this class because it has opened me up to new ways I can use my skills to contribute to real projects. While I may have been familiar with open source it is a bit difficult to find the motivation on my own to try and contribute instead of just simply taking advantage of the software, However, due to this class I've been given more insight to how these open source technologies I've been using have come to fruition and the different philososphy behind the development process. 

### What i've learned 

Learning the basic ediquette involved within contributing to open source was very helpful. Even something simple has reporting issues efficently is very important to the entire development process.
