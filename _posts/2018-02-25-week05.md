## Open Source Project

The type of project I would like to work on would be one that gives back to the developer community. For example, rust is an open source project that has made low-level programming safer, and that's a great tool to share with the development community. Some of the skills i can offer my team is familiarity with a Linux environment. My most comfortable language has to be Python, with Java being a close second. What I really want to learn from working on an open source project is exploring how other people code and build their software. I enjoy being able to deconstruct and understand all the different parts of the software. I want to be able to take it apart and see how it all works. My biggest fear would not being able to understand what someone else wrote It's a huge task, and to contribute to a massive project that has thousands of lines of code could be daunting.

## Mozilla Questions

1. What are some new open source project that might not be on most people's radar that you are excited about?
2. A quick glance at your website shows that you have worked on a lot of mapping/data projects. What is a project involving data that you feel has had the most impact/you are most proud of.
