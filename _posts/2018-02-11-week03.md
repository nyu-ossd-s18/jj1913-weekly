## Wiki Contribution 

The entire experience of contributing to wikipedia is very streamlined. Upon account creation i was given a tutorial on how to contribute on an actual wikipedia page that is already live. The website taught me about all the different ways to contribute to the page, whether it be through adding actual information, or checking broken links. The issues system is a nice addition which allows newer users to be able to contribute quickly. 

For my contribution, I decided to contribute to the list of linux repositories page. The page was a couple clicks away from the linux page on Wikipedia and was the easiest thing I could find I could contribute to that has to do with linux. I added the "Artix Linux" distrubtion under the list of distributions that use pacman as their package manager.
