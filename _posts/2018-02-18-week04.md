## Part One -  Website Fixes

I was unable to get an issue. Will update this part of the blog post later

## Part Two -  Code Triage

From my first impressions, Code Triage seems like a great way to become involved in open source projects. The directory was friendly and let me sign up for projects that interested me as well as made it easy to find which projects i might be interested based on which language I'm most familiar with. I ended up signing up for [django](https://github.com/django/django) which is a python framework I have become quite familiar with and [faker](https://github.com/stympy/faker) which is a library that helps generate fake data which also happened to peak my interest.

The posts I received for django were far more interesting then faker's (probably due to the fact that django is a much larger project). I was linked to a pull request which happened to be that specific user's first time contributing to an open source project and asked any users for advice. While the contributor's code was ripped apart, none of it really had anything to do with errors in his code, but rather his way of documenting. For example, making the order of the classes' in a specific python file to be created in a alphabetical order. As well as making sure tests are specific, and make sure tests aren't testing two things at once. Documentation seems to be a huge portion of open source contribution.
